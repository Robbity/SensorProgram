# X-ray Detector Analytics Program

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a program which would be able to interact with x-ray detector hardware and output the metrics as a compact user experience. A Ketek VIAMP H50 detector along with a VICO-DV adapter and a DPP3 interface board were used to connect to a laptop via an ethernet to USB adapter.

This was done in conjunction with Ketek VICO software, allowing better and simpler exploration of the complex data being transmitted.

The project required both UI design/creation, as well as data cleaning and manipulation. It provided a groundwork for me to develop my programming skills, while expanding my knowledge on a range of topics.

## Why this project?

The process to analyze data received by x-ray detectors uses older software which tends to lack efficiency and responsiveness, especially in real-time. This report explores the creation of a new, more user-friendly detector analytics program, highlighting the difficulties and successes of the process. 

Using detector hardware and a multitude of Python libraries, a more responsive application has been created. From this application, many possibilities for improvement and change have been found.
